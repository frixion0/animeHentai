# **App Name**: Seamless Viewer

## Core Features:

- Website Integration: Embeds a target website (specified by URL) within the application using an iframe.
- Seamless Presentation: Remove all visual indicators (borders, scrollbars etc.) that show the content is within an iframe, creating an integrated feel.
- URL Handling: Dynamically adjusts the iframe's source URL to match the initially-provided URL (https://animehentai.art/), so it matches the website content.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light grayish-blue (#B0C4DE), providing a calm, unobtrusive backdrop that doesn't distract from the content displayed within the iframe.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5), for a clean, modern look that subtly highlights the content area.
- Accent color: Soft blue (#77B5FE), used sparingly for interactive elements, ensuring focus remains on the embedded content.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif offering a modern and neutral aesthetic suitable for any supplementary UI elements outside the core content (e.g. settings).
- Clean and minimal design to put the main focus on the embedded content. No unnecessary elements, toolbars, or distractions.
